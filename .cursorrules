Project-specific rules for Cursor (Maria Talks Tech)

Context

- OS: macOS (darwin 24.6.0), shell: zsh.
- Repo path: <project-root> (this repository’s root)
- Keep responses concise and skimmable. Use bullets, minimal heavy formatting.

Terminal and commands

- Always begin commands by cd <project-root>.
- Prefer absolute paths over relative ones.
- Use non-interactive flags where possible (e.g., --yes).
- Assume no interactive input is available unless explicitly stated.

Git and GitHub

- Default to SSH for GitHub operations.
- Expected remote: origin = git@github.com:mashablair/maria-talks-tech.git
- If a Git push fails over HTTPS, suggest switching the remote to SSH instead of changing global config.
- When showing push instructions, include: git push -u origin main.

Node, npm, and tooling

- Use the public npm registry by default (https://registry.npmjs.org).
- Retain ability to use a private registry when explicitly requested; do not change global registry unless asked.
- When installing tooling on macOS, prefer Homebrew (brew).

Editing and style

- Do not reformat unrelated code.
- Preserve existing indentation width and style.
- Comments in code should explain non-obvious intent only.

Security & keys

- Never print private tokens or private keys.
- If SSH is needed, assume an ed25519 key at ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 using macOS Keychain.
